HOW I DID THIS ?

Analyze the packet capture file, I noticed that there are some FTP ports. so the chellenge discription was related to some files, so analyzing this, I got three Files, 
wire1, wire2, wire3 with some dumps.

Decoding the Dumps (Base64) and render the image (PNG) refer file signature of png. 

Note => Check for all the wire files and Never Giveup.
